# Intro

This is a little Python script which do some SMTP tests.

When I was young, I use this kind of site to test my installation but the [site](https://www.abuse.net/relay.html) has closed (and I do less mail server installation!).

I find the exact (?) same service and this script is entirely inspired by the wonderful and timeless website: http://www.aupads.org/

# Usage

Lauch the script `python3 main.py`, enter the server you want to test and wait :)

# Why

I want to learn Python and I try to do my own script. At the moment, I'm a beginner, so feel free to improve the script and propose some better code!
